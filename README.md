# Bubble Sort Algorithm

> The bubble sort algorithm is a fairly straight forward sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates over list comparing adjacent elements in the list and swapping the elements if they are in the wrong order.

>
> Although fairly simple to understand and implement the O(n^2) time complexity of bubble sort means it's performance drastically deteriorates as the size of the list increases.
>
> This project implements the bubble-sort algorithm in ruby using yield and block
